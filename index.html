        <h1>/ABOUT_ME</h1>
        <p>
          With over two years of experience in data science and ML, I'm passionate about applying my skills and knowledge to generate objective insights and contribute to responsible decision making.
          <br/><br/>
          Completing my Computer Science degree from CUNY Queens College in December 2023 has provided me with a robust technical foundation that was enriched by three notable programs (Break Through Tech AI, CUNY Tech Prep Data Science, and the Data Science Summer School with Microsoft Research) as well as an ML research position with Dr. Jonathan Gryak in 2023. My broad technical insight, combined with my background in Music Production & Engineering from Berklee College of Music, creates a unique blend of creative problem solving and analogous thinking skills which allows me to contribute a fresh, creative perspective to the evolving technological landscape.
          <br/><br/>
          I'm currently applying to full time roles in Data Science, Data Engineering, Machine Learning, and backend Software Engineering.

          <h1>/FUTURE/...</h1>
          <p>
            In the next five years, my goal is to gain comprehensive knowledge across various technology sectors, ranging from green energy and medicine to fintech, logistics, and consumer products. I am keen on exploring diverse industries to broaden my perspective and acquire a set of transferable and interdisciplinary skills so I may manage complex, impactful problems that improve the status quo in meaningful ways. A core value guiding my career is my commitment to advancing privacy, promoting equity, inclusion, and accessibility, and advocating for sustainable practices. I aim to join organizations where I can collaborate with and be mentored by individuals who are not only experts in their fields but also share a passion for innovation and progress for all. I’m particularly driven to lower barriers of entry to user-technology interactions, making them as natural and intuitive as interacting with a fellow helpful human.
            <br><br>
            A long-term creative ambition is to develop AI-driven music technology, crafting flexible tools that empower individuals across all skill levels to nurture their artistic and creative potentials. This comes from my journey as a woman navigating both the music and computer science industries and academic cultures, where I frequently encountered people deterred by perceived and existing obstacles within these fields. By combining my experience in music production and audio engineering with my proficiency in data science, machine learning, and software engineering, I aspire to transform these obstacles into gateway opportunities. My goal is to demystify technology and music education and creation, turning intimidation into inspiration, and “I can’t do this” moments into “I can’t wait to try this!” confidence.
