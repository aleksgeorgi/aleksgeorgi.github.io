            <h1>/ABOUT_ME/EXPERIENCE</h1>
            <p>I am a highly driven and well-rounded professional with technical, leadership, and creative experience, 
                currently pursuing a Computer Science degree at Queens College in order to realize a career change from 
                Music to Tech, particularly in fields that involve data exploration and modeling. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Through my studies and extracurricular programs, I'm working to develop precise and efficient analytical 
                processes to support my interest in Data Science/ML/AI, while continuing to build general software 
                development best practices and skills. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This summer, I was selected for a competitive AI immersion program promoting women in AI/ML, Break Through 
                Tech AI at Cornell Tech, where I earned an 8-week intensive Machine Learning Foundations certificate. 
                We completed weekly graded online modules, assignments, and in-person group labs relating to EDA, 
                data visualization, feature engineering, and model building.
                <br>
                <br>
                This fall, I also began as a Data Science fellow with CUNY Tech Prep, further building my proficiency 
                in the Python data science stack as well as industry best practices. Through CTP, I participated in my 
                first hackathon, making both web development and data science contributions, for which we won the top 
                prize for best overall submission. <a href = "https://devpost.com/software/mymuscles">[devpost link]</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                Earlier in 2021, I was matched as a first year CS student with industry professionals at Microsoft to engage virtually in a 6-week Tech Resilience Mentorship, resulting in necessary soft skills and strategies for navigating personal and professional challenges in Tech.

                    <p>
                        A long-term personal goal of mine is to bridge my background in music with technology. 
                        I'm especially interested in working on AI based VST plug-ins that generate curated and unique 
                        performances and acoustics, analyzing the iterations that the users interact most with and 
                        save to their environment, and releasing improvements based on those findings. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I’m curious about the implications of AI and big data on art, and not only to generally 
                        understand creativity as a standalone mechanism better but its importance and relationship 
                        with social behaviors as well. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ultimately, my hope is to study attributes that may contribute to "successful" musical 
                        compositions and develop innovative products that engage users from all backgrounds to help 
                        reduce barriers to developing creativity skills.

             <h1>/STORY/WHY_THE_CHANGE</h1>
             <p>I was born and raised in New York City to artistic Macedonian immigrants and always knew I had a talent for observation, interpretation, and expression. Until recently, the medium that attracted me most for exploring these instincts was music, and I went on to complete a BA with Berklee College of Music. Although music is rich in theory that is rooted in math and physics, my need to learn about and interact with the world evolved to require a more quantitative relationship as I grew through my various projects, gigs, and existential searches. After an entire life of thinking I was “not a math person”, I’m grateful to see I was only limiting myself with that mentality and to have had one amazing passion lead me to another.
